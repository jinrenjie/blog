Chrome has made adjustments to its developer tools in a recent update, specifically enabling an experimental option for the filter in the developer tools network panel, which has resulted in the filter no longer allowing quick selection of different types of requests as in previous versions.

This change has caused complaints from many developers, mainly due to its inconvenience, especially for developers who frequently use the developer tools.

This is not a new feature but rather an experimental option that was enabled by default. Chrome probably didn't anticipate it would cause so many complaints, especially since this new version has already been merged into Chrome 121 stable release.

Subsequently, Chrome issued an announcement apologizing for this issue and provided a rollback method. Developers can disable the new toolbar in settings to revert to the old version, and future releases will have this option disabled by default.

It used to look like this:

After the update, it changed to this:

How to restore:

* Open Chrome Dev Tool;
* Click the Settings button in the top right corner to enter the settings page;
* Click on the Experiments panel;
* Then type "Network" in the Filter text box;
* Uncheck "Redesign of the filter bar in the Network Panel".

I hope this is helpful, Happy hacking...
