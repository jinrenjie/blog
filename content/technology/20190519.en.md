# About Auto DevOps

In previous versions, Auto DevOps was disabled by default, but in the new version, it is enabled by default. Administrators need to disable it in the backend configuration.

![Enter settings page](/article/gitlab-setting-ci.png)

Uncheck the `Default to Auto DevOps pipeline for all projects` option, then click `Save changes`.

This way, newly created projects will no longer automatically enable Gitlab Auto DevOps. If needed later, you can configure it individually in each project.

I hope this is helpful, Happy hacking...
