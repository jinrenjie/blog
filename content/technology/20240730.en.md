# Introduction

[Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/) is an open-source alternative to Firebase/Google Analytics, built specifically for mobile, desktop, and web applications.

Its features include:

* Extensive SDK list: No matter what framework or language you use, we have an SDK for you. Swift, React Native, Flutter, Electron, Kotlin, and more.
* Privacy-first: We prioritize user privacy and collect minimal usage data without using unique identifiers. Instead, we focus on monitoring sessions, fully complying with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR regulations.
* Simple: Built-in and user-friendly dashboard with all your essential metrics, enabling you to easily gain insights and stay on top of your application's dynamics.
* Open Source: Our source code is 100% open source. Nothing hidden. All server code and SDKs are available for you to inspect and contribute to.

# Deployment

```yaml
services:
  aptabase:
    image: ghcr.io/aptabase/aptabase:main
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.aptabase.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.aptabase.rule=Host(`aptabase.svc.dev`)
      - traefik.http.routers.aptabase.service=aptabase
      - traefik.http.routers.aptabase.entrypoints=http,https
      - traefik.http.services.aptabase.loadbalancer.server.port=8080
    restart: no
    volumes:
      - ca:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates
      - certs:/etc/ssl/certs
    hostname: aptabase
    networks:
      - traefik
    environment:
      REGION: SH
      BASE_URL: https://aptabase.svc.dev

      SMTP_PORT: 1025
      SMTP_HOST: mailpit.svc.local
      SMTP_USERNAME: developer
      SMTP_PASSWORD: 7UWyH3uEhnShK6Al8uQCd1CCI4SdGkOE
      SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS: aptabase@betterde.com

      AUTH_SECRET: c4rI4x8kz5DgKJ1is5Eiu9bNncSQ6ROD
      DATABASE_URL: Server=postgresql.database.local;Port=5432;User Id=aptabase;Password=mC4MZj0EEX2Ulpyjh3K8MzZzPK72O7Ha;Database=aptabase

    container_name: aptabase

SMTP is used to configure authentication, and a login link will be sent to the specified email address when logging in.

> Aptabase itself relies on two databases, PostgreSQL and Clickhouse. Since I already have separate container instances for these databases locally, I won't create separate containers specifically for Aptabase!

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

# Project Integration

Create a project:

![Create App](/article/20240730-aptabase-create-app.png)

![Created](/article/20240730-aptabase-install-sdk.png)

![Select Framework](/article/20240730-aptabase-select-framework.png)

Here I'll use the Remix project from the official examples to run a demo!

```bash
gh repo clone aptabase/aptabase-js
```

![Project config](/article/20240730-remix-example.png)

# Running the Project

```bash
pnpm install

pnpm dev
> @ dev /Users/George/Develop/Node/aptabase-js/examples/remix-app
> PORT=4000 remix dev


 ðŸ’¿  remix dev

 info  building...
 info  built (292ms)
Remix App Server started at http://localhost:4000 (http://10.0.6.8:4000)
```
![Preview](/article/20240730-remix-preview.png)

At this point, the project integration is complete. When we click the button on the page, the frontend project will send events to Aptabase's API!

# Dashboard

![Dashboard](/article/20240730-aptabase-dashboard.png)

If everything goes as expected, you should be able to see event-related metrics on the project's Dashboard!

# Conclusion

For developers interested in independent development, there are many similar services available. Aptabase is relatively easy to get started with, and while its features may not be as comprehensive as other projects, it has all the essentials!

I hope this is helpful, Happy hacking...
