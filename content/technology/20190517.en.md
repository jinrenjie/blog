# Adding Domain Resolution Records

![Two Resolution Methods](/article/github-pages.png)

The official recommendation is to use the CNAME method because this approach allows you to leverage CDN for static resource distribution. If you use A records directly, loading static resources in articles might be slow.

## Creating a CNAME File

Create a `CNAME` file in the `docs` directory of your Github project repository. The content should be your domain name (without the HTTP protocol).

```

```

Then commit it to the `master` branch of your project repository.

# Setting Up HTTPS

![Open Project Homepage](/article/github-repository.png)

After entering the homepage, click on `Settings` to enter the settings page, and find the `Gitlab Pages` section.

![Set Custom Domain](/article/github-repository-setting-pages.png)

Enter your domain name in the text box under the `Custom domain` section, then click `Save`. Finally, check the `Enforce HTTPS` option. Github will apply for a certificate for your domain in the background. This process may take a long time, so please be patient.

When you see `Your site is published at https://*****.****.com`, it means the configuration has been successful!

I hope this is helpful, Happy hacking...
