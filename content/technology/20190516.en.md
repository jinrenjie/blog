description: I had been using Ghost as my blogging tool for a while. Although its admin interface is quite good, the editing interface for Chinese content is really poor. Eventually, I had to give up Ghost and choose Hexo instead.

# Required Environment

* Node.js
* Git

# Installation

```bash If you are using Yarn
yarn global add hexo-cli
```

```bash If you are using NPM
npm install hexo-cli -g
```

# Creating a Site

```bash
hexo init <folder>
cd <folder>
yarn or npm install
```

After creation, the directory structure of the specified folder is as follows:

```bash
.
├── _config.yml
├── package.json
├── scaffolds
├── source
|   ├── _drafts
|   └── _posts
└── themes

```

Now you can start writing your blog...

# Generating Static Files

```bash
hexo generate 
```

Hexo will create a directory for static files according to the `public_dir` configuration item in the `_config.yml` file (static files must run in an HTTP server environment). Here you need to set its value to `docs`, because Github Pages reads static files from the docs directory of the repository by default.

# Deployment

```bash Yan
yarn add hexo-deployer-git
```

```bash NPM
npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
```

## Configure Deployment Parameters

```yaml
# Deployment
## Docs: https://hexo.io/docs/deployment.html
deploy:
  type: git
  repository: git@github.com:USERNAME_OR_ORGNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git
  branch: master
```

## Deploy

```bash
hexo deploy
```

You can also deploy directly when generating static files

```bash
hexo generate --deploy or hexo deploy --generate
```
The above two commands produce the same result: first generate static files, then execute the deployment task! For detailed instructions, you can read the [official documentation](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/)

Next, I will write a blog post about how to set up a custom domain based on Github Pages and enable HTTPS.


I hope this is helpful, Happy hacking...
